## ⚡ Outre-Finance ⚡
### Transforming finance through decentralization. Empowering individuals with transparent, accessible, and inclusive financial services.

#### Project Description

Outre-Finance is an effort to build a borderless, customer-centric, all in one platform to serve as a trusted companion to manage and grow money while giving back control to users. By simplifying web3 for the less tech and financial savvy, we intend to increase utilisation of financial products across sub-Saharan Africa. The “take it or leave it” approach to financial products and pricing has locked out many, especially in the informal sector, from enjoying the benefits of current financial trends. Many in the informal sector underutilize these products due to high learning curves, costs and the commitment involved. While making payments is easy, participating in mediums that expose them to cheap lines of credit and saving pools still has high friction.
We know that making and receiving payments is not enough to build financial resilience and inclusion. Designing services that improve payments to make them safe, cheap, and fast while enabling alternative lines of credit, debt management and connecting individuals into saving pools will highly improve involvement.
##### Outre P2P Lending
68% of loans in the alternative lending market in Africa are P2P loans. With Outre P2P users are able to offer or request loans from each other at their own terms. Outre Finance helps with monitoring the Credit scores of users and only recommending matches to users in order to minimize the risk of default among users. This feature is very useful for those who survive on day loans to run small businesses for purposes such as inventory purchases. 
This product greatly reduces the cost of loans as it democratises lending and also opens other earning avenues for users through interest.
